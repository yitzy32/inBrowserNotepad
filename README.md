# inBrowserNotepad

Open this up to get a notepad in the browser to quickly paste some text or jot down important notes.
Some nice features this presents as opposed to putting `data:text/html,<html contenteditable>` into the search bar in the browser are
- The text is in monospace font. Easier to read code
- On page load the cursor is blinking in the body of the page so you can paste right when the page opens
